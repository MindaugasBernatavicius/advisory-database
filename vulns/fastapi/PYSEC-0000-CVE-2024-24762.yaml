id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-24762
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
details: FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard
  Python type hints. When using form data, `python-multipart` uses a Regular Expression
  to parse the HTTP `Content-Type` header, including options. An attacker could send
  a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is very difficult for the RegEx to process,
  consuming CPU resources and stalling indefinitely (minutes or more) while holding
  the main event loop. This means that process can't handle any more requests. It's
  a ReDoS(Regular expression Denial of Service), it only applies to those reading
  form data, using `python-multipart`. This vulnerability has been patched in version
  0.109.1.
