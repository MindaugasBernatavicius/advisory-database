id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-22946
details: "In Apache Spark versions prior to 3.4.0, applications using spark-submit
  can specify a 'proxy-user' to run as, limiting privileges. The application can execute
  code with the privileges of the submitting user, however, by providing malicious
  configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects architectures relying
  on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.\n\nUpdate
  to Apache Spark 3.4.0 or later, and ensure that \nspark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode
  is set to its \ndefault of \"false\", and is not overridden by submitted applications.\n\n\n"
