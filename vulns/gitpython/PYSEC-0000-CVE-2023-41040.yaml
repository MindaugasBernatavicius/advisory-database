id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-41040
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L
details: ' GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories. In
  order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory,
  in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython
  doesn''t check if this file is located outside the `.git` directory. This allows
  an attacker to make GitPython read any file from the system. This vulnerability
  is present in https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175.
  That code joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if
  the final path is located outside the base directory. This vulnerability cannot
  be used to read the contents of files but could in theory be used to trigger a denial
  of service for the program. This issue has not yet been addressed.'
