id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-32683
details: 'Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted
  framework. A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist`
  setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies.
  Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist`
  setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information
  returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or
  a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded. 2. For discovered
  image URLs, any non-image response is discarded. Systems which have URL preview
  disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist`
  are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised
  to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may also disable URL previews.'
