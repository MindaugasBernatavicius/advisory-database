details: MPXJ is an open source library to read and write project plans from a variety
  of file formats and databases. On Unix-like operating systems (not Windows or macos),
  MPXJ's use of `File.createTempFile(..)` results in temporary files being created
  with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system
  can read the contents of this file. When MPXJ is reading a schedule file which requires
  the creation of a temporary file or directory, a knowledgeable local user could
  locate these transient files while they are in use and would then be able to read
  the schedule being processed by MPXJ. The problem has been patched, MPXJ version
  10.14.1 and later includes the necessary changes. Users unable to upgrade may set
  `java.io.tmpdir` to a directory to which only the user running the application has
  access will prevent other users from accessing these temporary files.
