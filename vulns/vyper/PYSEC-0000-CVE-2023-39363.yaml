id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-39363
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
details: 'Vyer is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine
  (EVM). In versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0, named re-entrancy locks are allocated
  incorrectly. Each function using a named re-entrancy lock gets a unique lock regardless
  of the key, allowing cross-function re-entrancy in contracts compiled with the susceptible
  versions. A specific set of conditions is required to result in misbehavior of affected
  contracts, specifically: a `.vy` contract compiled with `vyper` versions `0.2.15`,
  `0.2.16`, or `0.3.0`; a primary function that utilizes the `@nonreentrant` decorator
  with a specific `key` and does not strictly follow the check-effects-interaction
  pattern (i.e. contains an external call to an untrusted party before storage updates);
  and a secondary function that utilizes the same `key` and would be affected by the
  improper state caused by the primary function. Version 0.3.1 contains a fix for
  this issue.'
