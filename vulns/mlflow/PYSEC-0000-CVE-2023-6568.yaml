id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-6568
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow
  repository, specifically within the handling of the Content-Type header in POST
  requests. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Content-Type
  header, which is then improperly reflected back to the user without adequate sanitization
  or escaping, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's
  browser. The vulnerability is present in the mlflow/server/auth/__init__.py file,
  where the user-supplied Content-Type header is directly injected into a Python formatted
  string and returned to the user, facilitating the XSS attack.
