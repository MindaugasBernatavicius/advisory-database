id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-3651
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
details: A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within
  the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's
  handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently,
  a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input
  that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable
  computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic
  manner relative to the input size.
