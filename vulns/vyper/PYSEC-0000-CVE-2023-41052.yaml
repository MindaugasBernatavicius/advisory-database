id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-41052
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
details: 'Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language. In affected versions the order
  of evaluation of the arguments of the builtin functions `uint256_addmod`, `uint256_mulmod`,
  `ecadd` and `ecmul` does not follow source order. This behaviour is problematic
  when the evaluation of one of the arguments produces side effects that other arguments
  depend on. A patch is currently being developed on pull request #3583. When using
  builtins from the list above, users should make sure that the arguments of the expression
  do not produce side effects or, if one does, that no other argument is dependent
  on those side effects.'
