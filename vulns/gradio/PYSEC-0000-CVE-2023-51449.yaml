id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-51449
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows you to quickly build
  a demo or web application for your machine learning model, API, or any arbitary
  Python function. Versions of `gradio` prior to 4.11.0 contained a vulnerability
  in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which
  an attacker could access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with
  a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face
  Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for. This issue has been patched
  in version 4.11.0.
