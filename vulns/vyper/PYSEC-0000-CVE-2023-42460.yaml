details: 'Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. The `_abi_decode()`
  function does not validate input when it is nested in an expression. Uses of `_abi_decode()`
  can be constructed which allow for bounds checking to be bypassed resulting in incorrect
  results. This issue has not yet been fixed, but a fix is expected in release `0.3.10`.
  Users are advised to reference pull request #3626.'
