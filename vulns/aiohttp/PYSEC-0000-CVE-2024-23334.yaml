id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-23334
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python.
  When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary
  to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks'
  can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root
  directory. When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check
  if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to directory traversal
  vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system,
  even when symlinks are not present.  Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse
  proxy are encouraged mitigations.  Version 3.9.2 fixes this issue.
