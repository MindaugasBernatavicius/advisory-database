id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-31208
details: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. A remote Matrix user with malicious
  intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially
  crafted events to exploit a weakness in the V2 state resolution algorithm. This
  can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of
  such instances, resulting in a denial of service. Servers in private federations,
  or those that do not federate, are not affected. Server administrators should upgrade
  to 1.105.1 or later. Some workarounds are available. One can ban the malicious users
  or ACL block servers from the rooms and/or leave the room and purge the room using
  the admin API.
