id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-45129
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
details: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
  Matrix.org Foundation. Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server ACL event can
  impact performance temporarily or permanently leading to a persistent denial of
  service. Homeservers running on a closed federation (which presumably do not need
  to use server ACLs) are not affected. Server administrators are advised to upgrade
  to Synapse 1.94.0 or later. As a workaround, rooms with malicious server ACL events
  can be purged and blocked using the admin API.
