id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2022-39335
details: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
  Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeservers to request
  the authorization events in a room. This is necessary so that a homeserver receiving
  some events can validate that those events are legitimate and permitted in their
  room. However, in versions of Synapse up to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver
  answering a query for authorization events does not sufficiently check that the
  requesting server should be able to access them. The issue was patched in Synapse
  1.69.0. Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade.
