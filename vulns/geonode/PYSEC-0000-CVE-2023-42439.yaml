id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-42439
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
details: GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing,
  and collaborative use of geospatial data. A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in
  version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user
  to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal
  network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can be bypassed.
  The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a whitelisted address,
  but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port
  8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. As of time of publication,
  no patched version is available.
