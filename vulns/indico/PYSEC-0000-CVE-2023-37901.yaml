id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-37901
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Indico is an open source a general-purpose, web based event management tool.
  There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used
  when deleting content from Indico. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission
  privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content.
  Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content
  when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The
  risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering
  pointing the victim towards this content. Users need to update to Indico 3.2.6 as
  soon as possible. See the docs for instructions on how to update. Users who cannot
  upgrade should only let trustworthy users manage categories, create events or upload
  materials ("submission" privileges on a contribution/event). This should already
  be the case in a properly-configured setup when it comes to category/event management.
  Note that a conference doing a Call for Abstracts actively invites external speakers
  (who the organizers may not know and thus cannot fully trust) to submit content,
  hence the need to update to a a fixed version ASAP in particular when using such
  workflows.
