severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies
  like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). There are no checks
  on whether the input is encrypted if a task is created in an encrypted collaboration.
  Therefore, a user may accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that
  will then be stored unencrypted in a database.  Users should ensure they set the
  encryption setting correctly.  This vulnerability is patched in 4.2.0.
