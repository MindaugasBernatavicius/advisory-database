id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-41335
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the
  Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords, the new credentials may
  be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any
  added capabilities—it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication
  process—it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database.
  As a result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups
  for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased
  after a 48-hour window. This issue has been addressed in version 1.93.0. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
