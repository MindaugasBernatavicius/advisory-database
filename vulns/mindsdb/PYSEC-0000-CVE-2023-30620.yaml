id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-30620
details: mindsdb is a Machine Learning platform to help developers build AI solutions.
  In affected versions an unsafe extraction is being performed using `tarfile.extractall()`
  from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted
  files to an unintended location. Sometimes, the vulnerability is called a TarSlip
  or a ZipSlip variant. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to overwrite any
  local file which the server process has access to. There is no risk of file exposure
  with this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release `23.2.1.0 `. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
