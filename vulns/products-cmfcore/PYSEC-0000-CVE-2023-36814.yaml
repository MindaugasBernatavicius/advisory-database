id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-36814
details: Products.CMFCore are the key framework services for the Zope Content Management
  Framework (CMF). The use of Python's marshal module to handle unchecked input in
  a public method on `PortalFolder` objects can lead to an unauthenticated denial
  of service and crash situation. The code in question is exposed by all portal software
  built on top of `Products.CMFCore`, such as Plone. All deployments are vulnerable.
  The code has been fixed in `Products.CMFCore` version 3.2.
