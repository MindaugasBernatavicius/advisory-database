id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-23329
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: ' changedetection.io is an open source tool designed to monitor websites
  for content changes. In affected versions the API endpoint `/api/v1/watch/<uuid>/history`
  can be accessed by any unauthorized user. As a result any unauthorized user can
  check one''s watch history. However, because unauthorized party first needs to know
  a watch UUID, and the watch history endpoint itself returns only paths to the snapshot
  on the server, an impact on users'' data privacy is minimal. This issue has been
  addressed in version 0.45.13. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.'
