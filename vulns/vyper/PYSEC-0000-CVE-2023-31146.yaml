id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-31146
details: Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine.
  Prior to version 0.3.8, during codegen, the length word of a dynarray is written
  before the data, which can result in out-of-bounds array access in the case where
  the dynarray is on both the lhs and rhs of an assignment. The issue can cause data
  corruption across call frames. The expected behavior is to revert due to out-of-bounds
  array access. Version 0.3.8 contains a patch for this issue.
