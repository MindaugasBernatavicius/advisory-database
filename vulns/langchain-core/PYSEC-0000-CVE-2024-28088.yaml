id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-28088
details: LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor who is
  able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call. This
  bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub
  GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language
  model online service, or remote code execution. (A patch is available as of release
  0.1.29 of langchain-core.)
