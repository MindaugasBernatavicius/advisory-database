id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-37902
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
details: Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual
  Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover precompile does not fill the
  output buffer if the signature does not verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will
  still return whatever is at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler
  has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data
  (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before
  the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature. Version 0.3.10
  contains a patch for this issue.
