severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted
  Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Airflow Spark
  Provider.\n\nWhen the Apache Spark provider is installed on an Airflow deployment,
  an Airflow user that is authorized to configure Spark hooks can effectively run
  arbitrary code on the Airflow node by pointing it at a malicious Spark server. Prior
  to version 4.1.3, this was not called out in the documentation explicitly, so it
  is possible that administrators provided authorizations to configure Spark hooks
  without taking this into account. We recommend administrators to review their configurations
  to make sure the authorization to configure Spark hooks is only provided to fully
  trusted users.\n\nTo view the warning in the docs please visitÂ  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/4.1.3/connections/spark.html
