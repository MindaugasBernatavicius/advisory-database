id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-43665
details: 'In Django 3.2 before 3.2.22, 4.1 before 4.1.12, and 4.2 before 4.2.6, the
  django.utils.text.Truncator chars() and words() methods (when used with html=True)
  are subject to a potential DoS (denial of service) attack via certain inputs with
  very long, potentially malformed HTML text. The chars() and words() methods are
  used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters,
  which are thus also vulnerable. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2019-14232.'
