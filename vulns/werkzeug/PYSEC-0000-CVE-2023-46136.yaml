details: 'Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload of
  a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without
  these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray
  and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker
  to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that
  will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling
  legitimate requests. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.1.'
