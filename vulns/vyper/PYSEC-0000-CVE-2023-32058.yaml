id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-32058
details: Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine.
  Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning
  the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the
  latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)`
  as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the
  compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable.
  The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.
