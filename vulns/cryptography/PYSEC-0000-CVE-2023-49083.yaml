id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-49083
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
details: cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and
  recipes to Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates`
  could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability
  poses a serious risk of Denial of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to
  deserialize a PKCS7 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions
  in system availability and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in version
  41.0.6.
