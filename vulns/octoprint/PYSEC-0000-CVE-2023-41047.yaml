id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-41047
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: OctoPrint is a web interface for 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until
  and including 1.9.2 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to configure
  a specially crafted GCODE script that will allow code execution during rendering
  of that script. An attacker might use this to extract data managed by OctoPrint,
  or manipulate data managed by OctoPrint, as well as execute arbitrary commands with
  the rights of the OctoPrint process on the server system. OctoPrint versions from
  1.9.3 onward have been patched. Administrators of OctoPrint instances are advised
  to make sure they can trust all other administrators on their instance and to also
  not blindly configure arbitrary GCODE scripts found online or provided to them by
  third parties.
