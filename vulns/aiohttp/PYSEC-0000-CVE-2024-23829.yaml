id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-23829
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
details: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python.
  Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences in
  allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame
  boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests.
  Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently
  with processing of other malformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards
  require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.
  The unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application
  server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete
  fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes this vulnerability.
