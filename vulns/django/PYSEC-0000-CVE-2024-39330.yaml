id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-39330
details: An issue was discovered in Django 5.0 before 5.0.7 and 4.2 before 4.2.14.
  Derived classes of the django.core.files.storage.Storage base class, when they override
  generate_filename() without replicating the file-path validations from the parent
  class, potentially allow directory traversal via certain inputs during a save()
  call. (Built-in Storage sub-classes are unaffected.)
