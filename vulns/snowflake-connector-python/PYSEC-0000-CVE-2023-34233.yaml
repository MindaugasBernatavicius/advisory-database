id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-34233
details: The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python
  applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations.
  Versions prior to 3.0.2 are vulnerable to command injection via single sign-on(SSO)
  browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection,
  an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource
  and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious,
  publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload.
  If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection
  URL, the userâ€™s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote
  code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as
  well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch for this
  issue.
