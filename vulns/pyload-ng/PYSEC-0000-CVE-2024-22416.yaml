id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-22416
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: 'pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python.
  The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session
  cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack
  possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API
  call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been
  addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.'
