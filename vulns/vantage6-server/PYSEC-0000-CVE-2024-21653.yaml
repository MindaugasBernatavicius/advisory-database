id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2024-21653
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
details: The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies
  like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC).  Nodes and servers
  get a ssh config by default that permits root login with password authentication.
  In a proper deployment, the SSH service is not exposed so there is no risk, but
  not all deployments are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive.  The
  vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the ssh part from the docker file and
  rebuilding the docker image.  Version 4.2.0 patches the vulnerability.
