id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-47627
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
details: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python.
  The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could
  lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is
  enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit
  `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.
