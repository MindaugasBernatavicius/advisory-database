id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-40170
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
details: jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Improper cross-site
  credential checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of certain file contents,
  or accessing files when opening untrusted files via  "Open image in new tab". This
  issue has been addressed in commit `87a49272728` which has been included in release
  `2.7.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the lower
  performance `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`,
  which implements the correct checks.
