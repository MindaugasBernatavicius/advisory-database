id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2023-41885
severity:
- type: CVSS_V3
  score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
details: Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In versions 0.120.0
  and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a
  malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid
  users on the platform. As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords,
  these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with
  the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform. The impact
  of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors
  in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform.
  The likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to
  pull off, especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based
  sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.
