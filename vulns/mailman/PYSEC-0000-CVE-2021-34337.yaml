id: PYSEC-0000-CVE-2021-34337
details: An issue was discovered in Mailman Core before 3.3.5. An attacker with access
  to the REST API could use timing attacks to determine the value of the configured
  REST API password and then make arbitrary REST API calls. The REST API is bound
  to localhost by default, limiting the ability for attackers to exploit this, but
  can optionally be made to listen on other interfaces.
